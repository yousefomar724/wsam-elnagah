## General info
---
My client's goal was to have a website for his business that is based on travel, so he asked me to make a website that is similar to another website that  already made.

I did the analysis, and began to write some layouts that are similar in various pages and sections, then built the home page as chunks or components and started building different sliders as there are a lot of them ðŸ˜…, and animations that appear in various places on the page.

After completing the UI, I started to integrate with the API and started to fetch data server-side with Next.js and display it.

In the end, I checked the lighthouse score to optimize to the maximum, connect with Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, and Google Search Console, and optimize SEO and performance.

Then put it all together and go to production, and ask if there are any modifications.
